## Overview
Our drone convoy protection system leverages AI for enhanced navigation, real-time object detection, and counter-drone capabilities. The project integrates various modules to ensure the safety and efficiency of military convoys.

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation with GPS**
- **Advanced Object Detection using YOLOv5**
- **Real-Time Counter-Drone Measures**
- **Battery Monitoring and Management**
- **Data Collection and Model Training**
- **Swarm Communication and Formation Management**
- **Error Handling and Logging**

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/drone-convoy-protection.git
    cd drone-convoy-protection
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
